#### Minesweeper is a puzzle game which the player selects a cell in a square grid continuously. Each cell hides a bomb or a value which displays the number of bombs in itâ€™s neighboring cells. The neighboring cells are defined as cells present adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If the player selects a cell containing a bomb, he/she loses the game.
